## Introduction

Made as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers (refer to the tests below for other variants):

- 555-555-5555
- (555)555-5555
- (555) 555-5555
- 555 555 5555
- 5555555555
- 1 555 555 5555

For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.


### Personal Aims

Succesfully solve the JavaScript challenge.

Convert the code from my completed challenge so that it works with a HTML page.

Improve my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript.

Have a project I can go back and refactor as I progress, for shorter code that's easier to understand and solves problems more efficiently.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- FCC Console

I developed the JS code in on FCC for the challenge, then used VSC to amend it and add it to HTML.

## Author Notes

When I first completed this project I'd written a lot of variable declarations and if statements. I was sure there would be a way to do this with less code and, sure enough, other people had done it in a few lines (using RegExp).

At the time I'd used little RegExp and vowed to go back over that and understand it better. Actually I found I got a lot more practice in when working on my [Cash Register](https://github.com/HalfElfAlistair/fcc-cash-register) repo.

Returning to this project I was comfortable producing much shorter code thanks to my improved RegExp knowledge. I still wasn't sure how so solve a small part so have recycled some code from my initial effort, I'm sure I can solve that with RegExp too but I'll pick that up over time.

For now, I'm much happier with this effort and, more importantly, the progress I'm making with RegExp.
